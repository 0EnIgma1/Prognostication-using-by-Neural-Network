Data Science in Agriculture. Comparison of linear and non linear model for pesticide sales forecast

Dataset contains pesticide name, sales volume in KG, time period, and countries using it.

2 models have been built to test the hypothesis - "The price of a pesticide depends on the sales of others" and sales forecast.

The models are:
- Linear Regression
- Artificial Neural Network
